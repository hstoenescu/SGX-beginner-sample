# Intel SGX - beginner's project

This is a simple intel sgx project that consists in only just 1 enclave (Enclave folder).
The enclave implements simple operations, like: add, diff, generate random number etc.

Used for inspiration the sample code found on this course: https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/isc/labs/03

For more information regarding the Intel SGX programming, please see the programming tutorial (Intel\_SGX\_programming\_tutorial.pdf)

Usage:
- make SGX\_MODE=SIM (for simulation mode using sdk) or SGX\_MODE=HW (for using SGX in hardware mode)
- run from the root folder the executable app: ./app
- fell free to change code/add new one/test it
